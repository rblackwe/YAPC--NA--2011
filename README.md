This talk will get you going using Arudino, an open-source electronics prototyping platform. You will learn the "Hello, World" blinking LED sketch. From this basic sketch I will expand to show you how to begin communicating with the Arduino and Perl. You will learn how to take input from the outside world to control events in your Perl programs. You will learn how to control the outside world using Perl. These basic skills will open up your I/O world and you will use Perl to glue it together of course.
